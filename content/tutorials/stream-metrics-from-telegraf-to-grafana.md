Grafana v8 introduced streaming capabilities â€“ a way to push data to UI panels in near real-time. In this tutorial we show how Grafana real-time streaming capabilities can be used together with Telegraf to instantly display system measurements.

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Setup Telegraf and output measurements directly to Grafana in near real-time

#### Prerequisites

- Grafana 8.0+
- Telegraf

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Set up your environment" >}}

First, you need to install Grafana and Telegraf. For Grafana [follow the instructions from documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/). And the same for [installing Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.18/introduction/installation/).

{{< tutorials/step title="Run Grafana and create admin token" >}}

1. Run Grafana
1. Log in and go to Configuration -> API Keys
1. Press "Add API key" button and create a new API token with **Admin** role

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Configure and run Telegraf" >}}

Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors.

In this tutorial we will be using Telegraf HTTP output plugin to send metrics in Influx format to Grafana. We can use configuration like this:

```
[agent]
  interval = "1s"
  flush_interval = "1s"

[[inputs.cpu]]
  percpu = false
  totalcpu = true

[[outputs.http]]
  url = "http://localhost:3000/api/live/push/telegraf"
  data_format = "influx"
  [outputs.http.headers]
    Authorization = "Bearer <Your API Key>"
```

Make sure replacing `<Your API Key>` placeholder with your actual API key. Save this config into file and run Telegraf pointing to it. Telegraf will periodically (once in a second) report the state of total CPU usage on a host to Grafana (which is supposed to be running on `http://localhost:3000`).

Inside Grafana Influx data is converted to Grafana data frames and then frames are published to Grafana Live channels. In this case the channel where CPU data will be published to is `stream/telegraf/cpu`. The `stream` scope is constant, the `telegraf` namespace is the last part of API url set in Telegraf configuration (`http://localhost:3000/api/live/push/telegraf`) and the path is `cpu` - the name of a measurement.

The only thing left here is create a dashboard with streaming data.

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Create dashboard with streaming data" >}}

1. Create new dashboard
1. Press Add empty panel
1. Select `-- Grafana --` datasource
1. Select `Live measurements` query type
1. Find and select `stream/telegraf/cpu` measurement for Channel field
1. Save dashboard changes

After making these steps Grafana UI should subscribe to the channel `stream/telegraf/cpu` and you should see a CPU data updates coming from Telegraf in near real-time.

{{< tutorials/step title="Stream using WebSocket endpoint" >}}

If you aim for a high-frequency update sending then you may want to use WebSocket output plugin of Telegraf instead of HTTP output plugin we used here. There is [an ongoing pull request to Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/pull/9188) we contributed that adds WebSocket output support. Once it's merged and released it will be possible to stream data to Grafana using configuration like this:

```
[agent]
  interval = "500ms"
  flush_interval = "500ms"

[[inputs.cpu]]
  percpu = false
  totalcpu = true

[[outputs.websocket]]
  url = "ws://localhost:3000/api/live/push/telegraf"
  data_format = "influx"
  [outputs.websocket.headers]
    Authorization = "Bearer <Your API Key>"
```

WebSocket avoids running all Grafana HTTP middleware on each request from Telegraf thus reducing Grafana backend CPU usage significantly.
